# Introduction

Previous work conducted as part of this project has calculated the % contribution to peak power load (kW) and to overall annual consumption (kWh) for the ~ 40 New Zealand GREEN Grid household electricity demand study dwellings [@stephenson_smart_2017].

EECA have expressed an interest in understanding how these results and/or this sample of dwellings can be scaled up to provide estimates of the same values for the overall New Zealand residential dwelling stock/household population.


As we have noted the sample of approximately 40 households used to do this is not likely to be representative of the
